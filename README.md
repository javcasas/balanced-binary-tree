# Balanced binary tree
This is a Prolog implementation of the paper   [Adams, S. (1993). Functional Pearls Efficient setsâ€”a balancing act. Journal of Functional Programming, 3(4), 553-561. doi:10.1017/S0956796800000885](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/functional-pearls-efficient-setsa-balancing-act/0CAA1C189B4F7C15CE9B8C02D0D4B54E)

Tested with [Scryer Prolog](https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog), but it works (with minor adaptations) with [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).

## Why Prolog
Because I can do `member(3, X).` and it starts generating all the possible trees that contain `3`, and I think that's pretty cool.
